=====

- need to reorder functions in the code so that closures are defined
  before being used...

- use Obj.infix_tag, ...

- env is last parameter

- C stubs to access the host functions

=======

- target GC proposal as well

- sections: creator + feature used

- check integer overflows (integers are 31 bits only...)

- Constants
  ==> statically allocated ==> int32/int64/floats

- we need to keep track of int32 constants

- Partial application / over application
  apply1 really fast
  apply2 fast through indirect function
  other cases slow

- Spilling
  Naive spilling for a start?

- specialize: divide by zero / modulus / check array bound

- Rebuild call-graph
  ==> check for unnecessary blocks, branches, returns

- local optimizations: constants used only once can be moved;
  avoid store followed by unique load
  ...
